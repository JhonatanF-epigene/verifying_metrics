List of things to do to organize the repository:
- make two functions to download the datasets but only the index with annotation
- split those datasets in two different folders for each model
- make the files of the imputations also (with different numbers of genes to calculate the threshold also for CancerFinder), and separate them in folders
- calculate the metrics with the predictions

The threshold of intersected genes is already calculate in the scTab! Only need to use different parameters on the CancerFinder to make those calculations.
